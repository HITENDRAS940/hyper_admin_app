# Admin App Archive

This folder contains the Admin functionality that was separated from the main User-focused application.

## Contents
- `src/screens`: Admin-specific screens (`AdminMoreScreen`, `ServiceManagement`, etc.)
- `src/components`: Admin-specific components.
- `src/navigation`: `AdminNavigator.tsx` responsible for Admin routing.

## Usage
These files are preserved here for future use if creating a standalone Admin application or reference.
To restore functionality, these would need to be integrated into a functional React Native project structure.
